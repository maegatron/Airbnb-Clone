Here, ContainerProps is an interface that describes the properties (or "props") that the Container component will accept.
children: React.ReactNode means that the Container component expects a prop called children, which is of type React.ReactNode.
React.ReactNode is a type that represents anything that can be rendered in React: elements, strings, numbers, or even null or undefined.*/
